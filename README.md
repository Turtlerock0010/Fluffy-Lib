## About
#### What is Fluffy Lib?
Fluffy Lib is a "library" that contains a bunch of modules and additions that were created overtime by The PFU's where they are directly within the robot's code so no external programs like [Imitate](https://github.com/Turtlerock0010/Imitate) or PI vision systems are going to be put into it. 

#### Why "Library" and not Library?
Although this repository is not a library in the sense of a collection of modules that you can directly reference in your code, it still contains a lot of useful functions that I have neatly organized into this single repository for internal and external team referencing so if you see something useful use it!
